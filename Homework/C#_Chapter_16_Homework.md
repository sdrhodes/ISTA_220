### C# Homework Chapter 16

### 1. Give five examples (using valid C# code) of the five bitwise operators listed in the text.
~(bit 1)
bit 1<<2
bit |= (1<<5)
bit &= ~(1<<5)

### 2. Does C# implement the right-shift (>>) operator? If so, give an example of its operation using valid C# code.
bits 10 >> 2

### 3. Explain in detail this code: bits & (1 << index);.


### 4. Explain in detail this code: bits |= (1 << index);.


### 5. Explain in detail this code: bits &= (1 << index);.


### 6. How does C# interpret this? bool peek = bits[n];


### 7. How does C# interpret this? bits[n] = true;


### 8. How does C# interpret this? bits[n] ^= true;


### 9. Assume that users were assigned read, write, and execute permissions according to this scheme: read= 1, write = 2, execute = 4. How would you interpret the following user permissions:
(a) permission = 0
(b) permission = 1
(c) permission = 2
(d) permission = 3
(e) permission = 4
(f) permission = 5
(g) permission = 6
(h) permission = 7



### 10. Answer the previous question by converting the decimal permissions into binary permissions. What does this tell you about using this scheme of permissions?
